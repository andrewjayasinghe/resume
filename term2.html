                 Usability design and testing, tight integration and collaboration with software
                  development processes are included in UX. This hands-on course is an introduction
                   to UX/UI for those who are creating user interfaces for web sites, mobile applications,
                    and information systems, as well as those who want a better understanding of the role of UX/UI.
                     In conjunction with 2911, students will follow an iterative and agile approach focusing 
                     on User-Centered Design (UCD) as the motivator for product direction. Participants will
                      be expected to work in teams, with an emphasis on collaboration, brainstorming, and continued evolution of an
                       interface concept based on UCD.</b></p>
