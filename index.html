                <b>ACIT 1515 </b></a><h2>(Scripting for IT with emphasis on Python)</h2></li>       
                <p class="black">
                    The course introduced the fundamental concepts of programming for IT professionals,

                 Projects, assignments, 
                 and activities are representative of tasks that IT professionals are likely
                  to encounter in the workplace. We had to design, 
                 implement, test, and debug programs that incorporated: variables, expressions, 
                 assignments, I/O, conditional and iterative control constructs, 
                 functions, and parameter passing. This was all done using The PYTHON Scripting Language</p></div>
